# CHESERA PROJECT CONTEXT

## CURRENT PRODUCT DIRECTION

Chesera is moving away from the active Twilio-first workflow for new messaging development.

The approved V1 messaging direction is:

- Sent.dm handles SMS.
- Sent.dm handles RCS.
- Sent.dm handles WhatsApp.
- Sent.dm handles dedicated messaging numbers.
- WhatsApp is optional in V1: agents may connect their own existing Meta-approved WABA using WABA ID, phone number ID, and access token.
- SMS/RCS activation must not be blocked by missing WhatsApp credentials.
- Each paid agent/company gets one isolated Sent.dm Sender Profile.
- Free users get dashboard access only, with no live messaging number.
- Agents never touch Sent.dm directly.
- Chesera owns the Sent.dm organization account and runs provisioning in the background.

Twilio code should remain untouched for now. Sent.dm should be added in parallel behind separate endpoints and models until the new flow is tested.

## CURRENT DJANGO STRUCTURE

This is a Django + Django REST Framework backend.

Important existing apps:

- `accounts`: custom phone-number users, OTP login, current user, free trial claim.
- `business`: organizations, business settings, provider accounts, phone numbers, notification settings, current Twilio onboarding endpoints.
- `core`: reference data, free trial numbers, Twilio configuration/webhook endpoints.
- `communications`: conversations, messages, AI analysis, outbound queue, webhook-event concepts.
- `crm`: leads, lead activity, tags, reminders.
- `ai`: AI configuration, prompt templates, AI usage/model logs.
- `subscription`: plans, subscriptions, payments, purchase verification.
- `twilio_app`: Twilio TrustHub/A2P/Toll-Free-specific models and services.

## IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS

- Do not remove or rewrite Twilio during the first Sent.dm implementation.
- Add Sent.dm as a separate integration path first.
- Do not hardcode API keys or webhook secrets.
- Store real provider credentials only in `.env`.
- Keep `.codex` files free of secrets.
- Every meaningful code change should also update the relevant `.codex` context/progress file.
- Track unfinished implementation work in `.codex/REMAINING_WORK.md`; update checklist statuses whenever work starts, completes, is blocked, or changes scope.

## CURRENT SENT.DM TEST STATUS

The client supplied a Sent.dm API key and account/user identifier. The API key was tested manually by the user:

- `GET /v3/me` works.
- `GET /v3/profiles` works and returned an empty profile list.
- `POST /v3/profiles` with `sandbox: true` returned a simulated Sender Profile response.

Important interpretation:

- The API key is valid for sandbox/API-shape testing.
- Sandbox responses do not prove real profile creation, real number provisioning, or real 10DLC submission.
- Sent.dm docs say real Sender Profile provisioning requires an organization account and an organization API key whose user has admin role.
- Before live rollout, confirm `GET /v3/me` returns `type: "organization"` with the production organization key.

## CURRENT VERIFICATION BASELINE

Last known local checks:

- `python manage.py check` passed.
- Full Python compile passed after the local verification comma fix.
- Focused backend tests now cover subscription, Sent.dm profile/campaign helpers, optional WhatsApp payloads, webhook signature verification, STOP/HELP webhook processing, Sent.dm AI replies, and AI compliance prompt rules.


## CURRENT SENT.DM WEBHOOK PROCESSING STATE

As of 2026-09-09, the deployed HTTPS webhook URL receives Sent.dm events:

```text
https://api.trychesera.com/api/v1/sentdm/webhooks/inbound/
```

The backend now verifies Sent.dm webhook signatures, stores raw webhook events, parses inbound message payloads, maps them to Sender Profile, organization, lead, and conversation when possible, and stores inbound messages in both `SentDMMessage` and `communications.Message`.

STOP/STOPALL/UNSUBSCRIBE/CANCEL/END/QUIT are handled before any future AI processing. The matched lead is permanently opted out, AI is disabled, active conversations are closed, and pending follow-up reminders are suppressed. HELP sends the organization's configured help response through Sent.dm.

Celery/Redis async processing is now wired for inbound Sent.dm webhooks. The request path verifies/stores the webhook and queues `process_sentdm_webhook_event_task`; STOP/HELP processing and AI reply generation happen in the worker. Normal inbound messages are mirrored into the CRM conversation, passed to the existing AI service, sent back through the matched Sent.dm Sender Profile, and stored as outbound `SentDMMessage` plus `communications.Message`. HOT AI stages disable lead/conversation AI for handoff. The AI prompt now includes business identity, support email, approved vertical/use case, STOP opt-out guidance, and Sent.dm/10DLC-safe response rules. Next messaging work is outbound send rules and follow-up channel routing; see `.codex/REMAINING_WORK.md` for the live checklist. Production migration note: `FollowUpReminder.id` intentionally remains UUID to match existing deployed database history.
